    <p>
        The earliest texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the 7th century.
        Three are written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and one, the Harshacharita, is in Sanskrit.
        One of these texts, the Chatrang-namak, represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess.
        The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang, the Pahlavi word for chess,
        was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' during the reign of Khosrow I.

    <p>
        Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets may not be literally white and black
        they are always referred to as "white" and "black". The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black,
        respectively. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. 
        Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles; for competition, the Staunton pattern is preferred.
