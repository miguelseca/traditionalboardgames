    <h2 id="tictactoe_history">Tic Tac Toe history</h2>

    <p>
        The earliest texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the 7th century.
        Three are written in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and one, the Harshacharita, is in Sanskrit.
        One of these texts, the Chatrang-namak, represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess.
        The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang, the Pahlavi word for chess,
        was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' during the reign of Khosrow I.

    <p>
        Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, 
        who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
